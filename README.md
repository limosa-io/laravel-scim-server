# Configuration

The configuration is retrieved from `SCIMConfig::class`.

Extend this class and register your extension in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` like this.

~~~.php
$this->app->singleton('ArieTimmerman\Laravel\SCIMServer\SCIMConfig', YourCustomSCIMConfig::class);
~~~

## An example override

Here's one way to override the default configuration without copying too much of the SCIMConfig file into your app.
~~~.php
<?php

class YourCustomSCIMConfig extends \ArieTimmerman\Laravel\SCIMServer\SCIMConfig
{
    public function getUserConfig()
    {
        $config = parent::getUserConfig();

        // Modify the $config variable however you need...

        return $config;
    }
}
~~~


# Security & App Integration

By default, this package does no security checks on its own. This can be dangerous, in that a functioning SCIM Server can view, add, update, delete, or list users. 
You are welcome to implement your own security checks at the middleware layer, 
or somehow/somewhere else that makes sense for your application. But make sure to do **something**.

If you want to integrate into _already existing_ middleware, you'll want to take the following steps - 

## Turn off automatic publishing of routes

Modify `config/scim.php` like this:
```php
<?php
return [
    "publish_routes" => false
];
```

## Next, explicitly publish your routes with your choice of middleware

In either your RouteServiceProvider, or in a particular route file, add the following:

```php
use ArieTimmerman\Laravel\SCIMServer\RouteProvider as SCIMServerRouteProvider;

SCIMServerRouteProvider::publicRoutes(); // Make sure to add public routes *first*


Route::middleware('auth:api')->group(function () { // or any other middleware you choose
    SCIMServerRouteProvider::routes(
        [
            'public_routes' => false // but do not hide public routes (metadata) behind authentication
        ]
    );

    SCIMServerRouteProvider::meRoutes();
});


```

# Test server

~~~
docker-compose up
~~~

Now visit `http://localhost:18123/scim/v2/Users`.
